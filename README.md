### DNAism

DNAism is a modified version of [Cubism](http://square.github.io/cubism/) aimed to work with genomic data.

[Cubism](http://square.github.io/cubism/) effectively allows you to visualize time-series data using [Horizon](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1483226) charts. In the x-axis you have time and in the y-axis you have whatever metric you are exploring for your dataset. For dna we have genomic coordinates instead of time.

Here is a screenshot of DNAism visualizing a region of simulated random data for 23+ samples:
