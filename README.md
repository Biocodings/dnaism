### DNAism

DNAism is a modified version of [Cubism](http://square.github.io/cubism/) aimed to work with genomic data.

[Cubism](http://square.github.io/cubism/) effectively allows you to visualize time-series data using [Horizon](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1483226) charts. With Time-series data in your metrics changes over time, with DNA
it changes over genomic coordinates.

I will be modifying this readme a lot so stay tunned!

Here is a screenshot of DNAism visualizing a region of simulated random data for 23+ samples:
